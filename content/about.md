### Features

<p>
    <span>Fast and lightweight:</span> Suckless's simple packages are used wherever possible. Using DWM with only the absolute required packages makes the operating system super minimalistic and only uses about 250 MBs of memory at boot that makes the OS super productive.
</p>
<p>
    <span>Simple and Free:</span> If anything can be simple, let's just simplify it. Our implementations should be written from shell and C/C++, and we love usable and simple package implementations, which are all freely available in <a href="https://github.com/metis-os" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="GitHub of Metis Linux">Github</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <span>systemd-less:</span> Stated by the unix philosophy, <strong>Make each program do one thing well</strong>, systemd includes many features that we never use; making the init system complicated. So <strong>RunIt</strong> is our init system of choice.
</p>
<p>
    <span>POSIX compatible:</span> We want our project can be easily portable to other operating systems.
