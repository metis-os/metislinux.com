### New to this kind of thing?
Are you interested in contributing to the project but new to these things? Don't worry! We have several ways in which you can contribute and get involved.

- One of the main ways to contribute is through code modification. 
        - The project utilizes the pacman package manager and various small tools within the operating system. If you're interested, you can start by exploring how runit works and understanding the workings of pacman. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the project's GitHub profile. Once you feel comfortable, you can edit any aspect that you think needs improvement or modification. After making the changes, you can create a pull request (PR) so that we can discuss and review your contribution.
- Share your customized desktop setup:
        - If you've themed a window manager or built one from scratch, we want to see it! Submit your work by creating an issue or sending a direct message. Let's collaborate to make MetisLinux more diverse and independent. Your contribution is valued and will enhance the user experience. Join us and make a difference!

- Testing: 
        - Does the setup actually work? We need you to find out if itâ€™s broken in some way :-)

- Website:

        - Help us translate, improve, and fix. Even if it's just a grammar mistake, your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

- Repos 
        - if you want to submit your package head over to [repos](/docs/guides/repos) 

if you can't do any of above? **star** ðŸŒŸ us on our [github](https://github.com/metis-os) and say METIS LINUX With pride :)
