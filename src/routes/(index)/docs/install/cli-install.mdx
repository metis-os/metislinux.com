# Install METIS the chroot way
**METIS Linux** is so much minimal that you can even install it using the standard *`chroot`* method, similar to distributions such as *`Arch` / `Artix.`*
I personally use this method because it allows you to customize your overall installation process, choose a different **kernel** and stuffs like that.

> It is not recommended for individuals who are new to Linux to install METIS Linux using the chroot method. Instead, they are advised to utilize the user-friendly Calamares installer.

In this guide i'll be installing **METIS** on *UEFI* system, the process goes the same to *BIOS*

Assuming you are aleady booted into *metislinux* ISO and the internet is working fine.

Open **terminal** with *(super + enter)* and follow along the below guide.

## Initializing the disk
Once you booted into the iso, do `lsblk` and see on which disk to install metislinux on. I'll be installing on my `nvme0n1` drive.
```bash
$ lsblk
NAME      MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE    RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda       8:0     0    931.5G  0                                # Hard drive 
sdb       8:16    1    29.3G   0                                # pendrive of metislinux
nvme0n1   259:0   0    119.2G  0 disk                           # installation drive
```

## Creating partitions
- Use `fdisk` to create two partition out of the disk, and format the boot partition with `mkfs.vfat -F32` and another with `mkfs.ext4` 
- Now, mount the `root partition`  to `/mnt`.
- Create a `boot` directory inside `/mnt` (You can also use `/boot/efi`). 
- Mount the boot partition to `/mnt/boot`. (if you have made a `/boot/efi` directory mount it there but it doesn't really matter).

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/303293.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

## Install base system
Now, it's time to install the `base` packages from the `repo`.
run
```bash
$ basestrap /mnt base base-devel runit elogind-runit linux-hardened intel-ucode linux-hardened-headers neovim linux-firmware metis-fonts nerd-fonts-jetbrains-mono eww-x11 xclip tmux paru xorg-xinit metis-dwm zathura zathura-pdf-poppler git fzf doas zsh xwallpaper python3 python-pip python-pywal fontconfig xorg-mkfontscale zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting  zsh-completions xdg-utils xdg-user-dirs zoxide
libnotify grub mpv ffmpeg pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber rustup metis-grub-theme neworkmanager networkmanager-runit efibootmgr
```

<br />
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/172619.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

> Note, I've installed the very basic packages , you can even filter out on this and choose which to install !!

## Generate fstab

Now, it's time to generate `fstab` of our system. 
```bash
$ fstabgen -U /mnt /mnt/etc/fstab 
```



<br />
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/191267.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

If you want to create a swap partition, then run

```bash
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1G count=2 status=progress
```
<br/>

It will create a swapfile of `2GIB`, you can adjust by increasing // decreasing the bs,count value.
After creating the swapfile, we need to add into our fstab file so that every time we boot into our system, it automatically detects the partition to mount.
to do so, just exit out the shell and run 

```bash
$ fastabgen -U /mnt /mnt/etc/fstab && metis-chroot /mnt
```


## Chroot into the system
Now, `chroot into the new system`
```bash
$ metis-chroot /mnt /bin/bash # this will open a bash(chroot) instance of newly installed system. you can switch to another shell also.
```
## Setup time zone
Now, `symlink` your localtime and `hardwareclock` as follows


<br />
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/218213.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

```bash
$ ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/kathmandu/  /etc/localtime
````



here,  `writer` is my machine name and `Asia/kathmandu` is my localtime.

## Install bootloader

After doing this, we can install the `grub` bootloader as below.


<br />
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/336479.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

## Adding users

After installing grub, we can add a normal user and give a password to it .
to add a normal user run 
```bash
$ useradd -mG wheel,video,audio,power,dbus,storage <username> #the groups listed here are most necessary ones
```

now, run 
```bash
$ passwd root 
$ passwd <normal_user>
```
to set password of users and now we can give ***sudo privilege to wheel group users*** by running the following and uncommenting the line 
```%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL```

```bash
$ EDITOR=nvim visudo  

```
<br/>

and 
Now, we can simply reboot the system by unmounting the drives as follows. If everything went well, you'll see a grub menu to select 
metislinux to boot.


```bash
$ exit 
$ umount -Rl /mnt
````

# Setting up services

Runit system is a lil' bit different than other, it uses symlinking feature to enable services in the system. after exiting out of the system, go and login into your newly
installed system. if it was an another init system, we could be just enabling the services right after the base install but in `runit`, 
we actually symlink the services from `/etc/runit/sv/<service_name>` to `/run/runit/service/<service_name>`, eg `NetworkManager`

To enable `NetworkManager` we can do the following
```bash
$ sudo ln -s /etc/runit/service/NetworkManager /run/runit/service/NetworkManager
```

It goes similar to any other services
