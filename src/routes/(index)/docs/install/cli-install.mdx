# Install METIS the chroot way
**METIS Linux** is so much minimal that you can even install it using the standard *`chroot`* method, similar to distributions such as *`Arch` / `Artix.`*
I personally use this method because it allows you to customize your overall installation process, choose a different **kernel** and stuffs like that.

> It is not recommended for individuals who are new to Linux to install METIS Linux using the chroot method. Instead, they are advised to utilize the user-friendly Calamares installer.

In this guide i'll be installing **METIS** on *UEFI* system, the process goes the same to *BIOS*

Assuming you are aleady booted into *metislinux* ISO and the internet is working fine.

Open **terminal** with *(super + enter)* and follow along the below guide.

# initializing the disk
Once you booted into the iso, do `lsblk` and see on which disk to install metislinux on. I'll be installing on my `nvme0n1` drive.
```bash
$ lsblk
NAME      MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE    RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda       8:0     0    931.5G  0                                # Hard drive 
sdb       8:16    1    29.3G   0                                # pendrive of metislinux
nvme0n1   259:0   0    119.2G  0 disk                           # installation drive
```

# For `UEFI`
- Use `fdisk` to create two partition out of the disk, and format the boot partition with `mkfs.vfat -F32` and another with `mkfs.ext4` 
- Now, mount the `root partition`  to `/mnt`.
- Create a `boot` directory inside `/mnt` (You can also use `/boot/efi`). 
- Mount the boot partition to `/mnt/boot`. (if you have made a `/boot/efi` directory mount it there but it doesn't really matter).

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/303293.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />


Now, it's time to install the `base` packages from the `repo`.
run
```bash
$ basestrap /mnt base base-devel runit elogind-runit linux-hardened intel-ucode linux-hardened-headers neovim linux-firmware metis-fonts nerd-fonts-jetbrains-mono eww-x11 xclip tmux paru xorg-xinit metis-dwm zathura zathura-pdf-poppler git fzf doas zsh xwallpaper python3 python-pip python-pywal fontconfig xorg-mkfontscale zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting  zsh-completions xdg-utils xdg-user-dirs zoxide

```

<br />
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/172619.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

> Note, I've installed the very basic packages , you can even filter out on this and choose which to install !!

Now, it's time to generate `fstab` of our system. 
```bash
$ fastabgen -U /mnt /mnt/etc/fstab 
```



<br />
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/191267.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

Now, `chroot into the new system`
```bash
$ metis-chroot /mnt /bin/bash # this will open a bash(chroot) instance of newly installed system. you can switch to another shell also.
```

Now, `symlink` your localtime and `hardwareclock` as follows


<br />
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/218213.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

```bash
$ ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/kathmandu/  /etc/localtime
````



here,  `writer` is my machine name and `Asia/kathmandu` is my localtime.

After doing this, we can install the `grub` bootloader as below.


<br />
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/cli/336479.png" alt="Chroot initial" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

After installing grub, we can reboot the system.
```bash
$ exit 
$ umount -Rl /mnt
````

# Setting up services

runit system is a lil' bit than other, it uses symlinking way to enable services in the system.
