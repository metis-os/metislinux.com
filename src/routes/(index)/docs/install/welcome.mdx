<p align="center"><strong>Your true source for the documentation and information about METIS Linux. </strong></p>


[**METIS Linux**](https://metislinux.org) is a linux distribution embodying the *KISS* and *unix* philosophy. It uses simple 
**init systems** instead of *systemd* and super minimal **window managers** to level up your productivity. I, [*@PwnWriter*](https://github.com/PwnWriter)
started this project as a hobby project but now it has been evolved into a full-fledged distro for both **beginner** and **advanced** users.

> This wiki will cover **METIS Linux** related documentation from the base install to configurating the overall distribution.


**To get started, download the latest ISO of Metis Linux from its official [releases](https://github.com/metis-os/Releases) page, and then follow the instructions provided below.**
## Creating a bootable drive
### Using dd (linux)

- Linux:
        If you are already on *Linux* you can easily create a bootable USB for Metis Linux using the dd command. 
        This method is highly recommended due to its simplicity and universal availability. Here's how:

        First find the usb to make it bootable. run
        ```bash 
        $  lsblk
        NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
        sda      8:0    0 298.1G  0 disk
        ├─sda1   8:1    0     4G  0 part [SWAP]
        ├─sda2   8:2    0   512M  0 part /boot
        └─sda3   8:3    0 293.6G  0 part /
        sdb      8:16   1   31.7G  0 disk
        ```

        For me, it's `sdb`, 

        ```bash
        $ sudo dd if=/path/to/metislinux.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
        ```
        <br></br>
       * Make sure to replace path/to/metis.iso with the **METIS ISO** path and sdX with your USB device.
       * This will create a bootable Metislinux USB for both **BIOS and UEFI**.
