# Install METIS with Calamares
This is a straightforward guide for beginners and Linux newcomers to install MetisLinux on their system without encountering any issues. In this guide, I will provide instructions for installing MetisLinux on a UEFI system. However, the process remains the same if you are using BIOS. Please follow the steps outlined below to successfully install MetisLinux.


## Preliminary Steps

Assuming that you have already created a [bootable](https://metislinux.org/docs/quickstart/welcome) USB with Metislinux ISO, boot system with it and select Boot Metislinux. Launch the installer via either **Terminal** ***(SUPER+Enter)*** or Dmenu ***(MOD+space)*** keys. To connect internet you can use ```nmtui``` command in the **Terminal**.

        </div>

<br />

Now select your **Region, Time Zone, System Locale** etc and click on <b>`Next`</b>. *`If you are connected to internet this will show automatically`*. 



        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/calamares/131632.png" alt="select locale" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

Select your **Keyboard Layout** and click <b>`Next`</b>. *`The keyboard layout is automatically adjusted to selected system locale`*.

                <img src="/installation/calamares/328809.png" alt="select locale" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />
### Partitioning

> Note **In this guide, All partitioning are performed on an empty disk.**

Now, here comes the **critical** stage where many Linux beginners make **mistakes**. Take care and ensure that you are well-informed before engaging in any system partitioning. Understanding the partition scheme is strongly recommended to avoid complications. If you are a beginner you can just stick with *`Erase`* disk, which will
erase your disk and install Metislinux.

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/public/installation/calamares/850438.png" alt="select locale" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

## Completing
Create a **user account** for you, using the simple form, and click <b>`Next`</b>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/calamares/987809.png" alt="calamares form" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />
Here's the installation summary, including the changes you've made and the upcoming actions by the installer. Take a moment to review it, and once you're content, <b>`Next`</b>.

 <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

                <img src="/installation/calamares/930781.png" alt="calamares install" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>

<br />

The installation process has **commenced**. It may take a few minutes, so feel free to glance through the slides or take a short break, perhaps grabbing a coffee.
 <div style="display: flex; justify-content: right;">

        </div>

<br />

When It's done, click <b><b>`restart now`</b></b> to reboot the system instantly.
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: right;">

                <img src="/installation/calamares/203090.png" alt="calamares finish" height="80%" width="80%" />

        </div>
