# Patch suckless softwares

[Suckless Software](https://suckless.org) refers to a collection of lightweight, minimalist software developed by the Suckless community. These programs are known for their simplicity and focus on core functionality. One of the key aspects of using Suckless Software is the ability to customize and patch the programs to suit individual preferences. This guide will walk you through the process of patching Suckless Software.

I'm going to add patch to dwm.

- Download the [patch](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/swallow/dwm-swallow-6.3.diff) from suckless's site
- if you want to patch [metis-dwm](https://github.com/metis-os/metis-dwm), clone it and cd inside dwm directory.
 I'm going to be using the fresh dwm coz it's just the same.

 So, to patch run 

 ```bash
$ patch -p1 < patches/dwm-swallow-6.3.diff
  patching file config.def.h
  patching file config.mk
  Hunk #1 succeeded at 20 with fuzz 1.
  patching file dwm.c
  Hunk #4 succeeded at 244 (offset -1 lines).
  Hunk #5 succeeded at 284 (offset -1 lines).
  Hunk #6 succeeded at 315 (offset -1 lines).
  Hunk #7 succeeded at 435 (offset -1 lines).
  Hunk #8 succeeded at 722 (offset -1 lines).
  Hunk #9 succeeded at 1101 (offset 9 lines).
  Hunk #10 succeeded at 1122 (offset 9 lines).
  Hunk #11 succeeded at 1157 (offset 9 lines).
  Hunk #12 succeeded at 1855 (offset 18 lines).
  Hunk #13 succeeded at 1884 (offset 18 lines).
  Hunk #14 succeeded at 2153 (offset 18 lines).
  Hunk #15 succeeded at 2372 (offset 18 lines).
 ```

 if hunk fails, you have to manually add those lines, to respective files.

 After this just run

 ```bash
$ sudo/doas make clean install
 ```
<br/>
 that's it
