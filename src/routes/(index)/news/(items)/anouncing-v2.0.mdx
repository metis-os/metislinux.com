Alright, everyone, let's get straight to the point. I assume you are familiar
with MetisLinux. If not, it's a distribution that follows the KISS (Keep It
Simple, Stupid) and Unix philosophy. 

It's hard to believe that it's been a year since the first major version of
MetisLinux was released on that special day, July 11 (me and my dad's birthdayyy). But here we are, ready to
bring you another fantastic release. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude
to all of you who have supported and contributed to the project. Your feedback
and enthusiasm have been invaluable.



This release brings you the everything you've asked for
things that have been added

- The gui installer (calamares)
- pywal support (change colors on the fly)
- Blazingly fast neovim config (pwnvim)
- Beautiful and very useful applets and menus


Things that have been removed
- Prooly one and only thing, the metis-sideload way to install metislinux.

Ig this is it for this time. Thank you all, and stay tuned for more exciting updates on MetisLinux in the future!
